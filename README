Usage:

1) Put the shows you like to watch in ep.rc 

2) Then run eplists.sh from a shell, it will create the file latest.html and open it with lynx, a shell-based browser

Notes:
- ep.py was not written by me, only slightly modified.
- eplists.sh is one way to look at this data. feel free to write other wrappers, this is what I found useful
